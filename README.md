The Purpose of the Research Project, 
1. This is a group project. as a team we built a mobile application to support people who are suffering from PTSD. 
2. because most of the people do not like to visit counselor due to their imagine/ society. 
3. this is good place to find out their problem and find out instructions to overcome the situation as well as get the treatments from well known counselors.
4. this app consists with AI powered chatbot, stress level detection via video footage, giving instructions to overcome the problem. 
5. my part was build machine learning model to predict the stress level of patients. I created the CNN model to predict the stress level 
based on facial expressions + body movements and identify the mood of the patient(Happy, Sad, Neutral, ..).
